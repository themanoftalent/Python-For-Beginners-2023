## Variable definition

Variables are used to store values so we can refer to them later. A variable is like a label, and you use the ' `=` ' symbol, known as the assignment operator, to assign a value to a variable. An assignment can be chained, e.g. `a = b = 2`   
  
Change the value stored in the variable `greetings`.  

<div class="hint">Type value here.</div>
