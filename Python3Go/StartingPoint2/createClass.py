# CLASSES AND OBJECTS -------------
# The concept of OOP allows us to model real world things using code
# Every object has attributes (color, height, weight) which are object variables
# Every object has abilities (walk, talk, eat) which are object functions

    # None signifies the lack of a value
    # You can make a variable private by starting it with __
    __name = None

    # self allows an object to refer to itself inside of the class
