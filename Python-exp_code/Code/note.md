### Python learing documents

## judgetment

if: must be followed by ':' and will note include '()', unlike C/C++.


### While
for C/C++ programmer:
 while could be followed by an else sentense, when will it excute? 
when the while-condition is false, the while - else judgement will run to 
the else sentense to excute.(unlike the C/C++)

### for
range(1,5) means [1, 2, 3, 4, 5), that is [1, 2, 3, 4](doesn't include the end number) 
it represents an array of numbers.

Note that we could assign an steplength to it using range(1,5,2),which means[1,3]
that the third number is the steplength.
