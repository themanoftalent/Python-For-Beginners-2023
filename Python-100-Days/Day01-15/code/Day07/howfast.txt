There are many aspects to this because the eye does not behave like a video camera or a film camera.

The eye can see a flash that is much shorter than a microsecond if it is bright enough.

But two flashes have to be about a 30th of a second apart before you can notice that there are two flashes.

When movies were first projected at 24 frames a second, many people perceived annoying flicker. To overcome this, each frame was projected rapidly 3 times. This resulted in flashing the screen 72 times a second. The vast majority of people found this to be perceived as relatively smooth without flicker.

Our temporal response in our peripheral vision is different from our central vision. We are more sensitive to motion and flicker in the peripheral vision.

On the other hand, if you do a strobe light even at 60 or 100 times a second, you can perceive that a fast moving object is not moving smoothly but appears to stop at several spots along the way. This is a key observation. If you use CGI or a camera with a very high speed shutter, like 1/1000 second, you are going to be able to see discontinuous motion. However, if you take the same film, and project it at 30 frames per second with a shutter speed of about 1/30 second, you don’t perceive the flicker or the strobe effect. All you really need is about 30 frames a second. However, digitally generated action or high speed shutter cameras are going to cause a strobe effect to occur. It’s not that your eyes can see more frames, it’s that the strobe effect is actually in the film.

Because the average film these days involves high speed shutters and CGI, it is the film itself that makes the action seem less than fluid and smooth. People go to higher speed monitors and interpolate frames to make the action smoother. But it’s not your eyes: it is actually unsmooth video with a strobe effect encoded in the video.
