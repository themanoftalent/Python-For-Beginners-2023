00:00 All right, it's your turn to do some logging.
00:02 Let's look at all the steps that I'm recommending for you.
00:06 So there's a little summary of why you care about logging,
00:09 but we're going to focus on the three things,
00:12 the three days, and what you're going to do on them.
00:13 Today, you're basically done.
00:15 It's watch the videos as usual.
00:18 What you're going to do is you're going to pick an application
00:20 that either you've built in this course or previously built
00:23 that you think could use some logging.
00:25 It would be nicer if it had some logging
00:27 much like we just added to the movie search app.
00:29 So your goal for today is just to pick an app
00:32 that you're going to study and add logging to
00:34 over today and the next two days that follow.
