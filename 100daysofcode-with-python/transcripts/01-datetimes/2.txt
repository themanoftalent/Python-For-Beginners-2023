00:00 Right a quick overview of what we're doing for the next
00:03 couple of days.
00:04 For the first day of your datetimes lessons you're going to
00:08 watch the videos, okay?
00:10 A couple of videos for you to watch to do with datetime,
00:12 date, and timedelta.
00:15 Alright after you've done, after you've completed watching
00:17 the videos go ahead and just play around in the shell.
00:21 So do some timestamp calculations as per the content
00:25 in the videos.
00:26 So we won't dwell on that too much.
00:28 The second day I want you to head to our challenges,
00:32 our challenges platform I should say and sign up with your
00:36 GitHub account.
00:37 It's free and then follow this link here and this will
00:40 unlock this datetimes challenge, okay?
00:46 This bite here is going to be based around parsing dates
00:50 from logs.
00:52 Okay so have a play with it, code in the browser
00:55 and have fun.
00:56 That's your day two.
00:58 Then day three.
01:00 That is all going to be up to you.
01:02 Create something for yourself.
01:04 I reckon you should give a Pomodoro timer a chance.
01:08 Use datetime for it.
01:10 I know you can just use a time module for these
01:12 examples here but the idea is to include some timestamps.
01:16 Do some calculations and see what you can wrap around date
01:19 time okay so the Pomodoro timer is quite simple.
01:24 You can do that or you can do a stop watch.
01:26 Anything like that.
01:28 So if you have any ideas yourself now is your time to
01:30 test it out on day three.
