00:00 Wow, look where you are!
00:02 It's Day 100.
00:03 This is literally the last day of your #100DaysOfCode.
00:08 Congratulations, it's time to freestyle!
00:10 You've earned a little bit of freedom.
00:12 So is there some project that you've worked on so far
00:15 that maybe you didn't finish, you really wanted to?
00:17 Go back and finish that one.
00:19 Is there some derivative type thing you want to create?
00:22 Like maybe you'd like a web version of The Wizard game?
00:25 Then go build that.
00:27 Of course it's your time to freestyle,
00:28 so if you would rather just go do something
00:30 totally different, something you wanted explore
00:33 as part of this journey, here's your final day
00:35 to go work on that project.
00:37 Whatever it is you want to do.
00:38 You've earned this, go have fun
00:41 and celebrate this by working for the final day
00:43 on something you're super excited about.
