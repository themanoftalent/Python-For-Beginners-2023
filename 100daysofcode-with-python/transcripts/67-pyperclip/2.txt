00:00 Okay, very quickly,
00:01 here's how your first three days for pyperclip
00:04 are going to pan out.
00:05 So for the first day, you're actually just going
00:07 to learn how to use pyperclip.
00:09 That shouldn't take long, only a couple of minutes,
00:11 because it's very simple.
00:13 And after that, you're going to generate
00:15 an affiliate link using pyperclip.
00:18 That's a script that we use,
00:19 and it's actually quite useful.
00:21 You've got a used case there that you can probably change
00:26 to suit your needs, so that's a great script
00:28 to be creating on Day 1. Okay?
00:31 Day 2, you're going to do the same thing,
00:33 you're going to create another script.
00:35 So these are going to be a few easy days,
00:37 you're just creating stuff for yourself, right?
00:40 Create a text replacer script.
00:42 Now this one will, well, you can read here.
00:44 It allows you to replace text using pyperclip.
00:48 I won't give too much away, watch the videos.
00:51 And last but not least, Day 3,
00:54 come up with something yourself using pyperclip.
00:57 Okay, so you've got the basics down,
00:59 well, it's all basic, right?
01:02 And what you need to do is create a challenging project
01:05 for yourself, okay?
01:06 You can complete it or not on Day 3, it doesn't matter,
01:09 but one great idea is a persistent clip board.
01:14 Something that will, I guess, save the things
01:18 that you copy to the clipboard,
01:19 and then allow you to paste them all back later.
01:22 That's a really cool idea.
01:24 Another one would be a sort of password vault.
01:27 It doesn't have to be secure.
01:28 I wouldn't actually recommend using it,
01:30 but create a password vault that uses pyperclip
01:33 to do the copying of your password
01:35 for when you want to paste it out somewhere.
01:38 So these are some cool used case ideas,
01:41 use your imagination, and make something great.
