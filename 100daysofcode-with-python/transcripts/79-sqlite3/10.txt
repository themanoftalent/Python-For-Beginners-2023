00:00 All right, here's how we're going to break down
00:02 these 3 Days on SQLite3 Databases.
00:05 So to start off with you're going
00:07 to install SQLite db browser.
00:11 All right watch the video on that, get it done.
00:13 Then you're going to create your first database,
00:16 or your first sqlite three database, anyway.
00:19 And that's going to quickly be followed by
00:21 a script that generates a database for you.
00:25 So I'm going to demonstrate that for you,
00:26 and it's actually quite useful so, enjoy that one.
00:30 For Day 2, what I'd like you to start doing
00:33 is inserting data into the address book.
00:37 Okay this is the address book database
00:40 that you were going to create in Day 1.
00:42 So Day 2 is, so Day 1 is going to be create the database
00:47 Day 2 is going to be insert data into the database, okay?
00:52 And it's then going to quickly be followed up with
00:56 extracting that data, so pulling the data out with select.
01:01 Okay, all that's explained in the videos.
01:04 Now, Day three, what you're going to do is
01:09 apply everything you've learned into your own project.
01:14 Okay, so by the end of Day 2 you'll have created
01:17 the address book and you'd be able to pull data out
01:20 and insert data into it as you wish.
01:23 So now, try and replicate that
01:25 with something else you can think of.
01:26 Okay copy as much as you want.
01:28 Remember the purpose here is to just practice
01:31 with the code and once you have that down
01:33 if you still have time for Day three,
01:35 figure out how to edit the data in the database, okay.
01:41 So a quick one here is we are inserting
01:44 and extracting the data, we're not editing it.
01:48 Okay we don't cover that in the video,
01:51 so that's a nice little stretch goal for you.
01:52 So do your googling and play around with it
01:55 and see if you can edit the data,
01:57 that's your challenge for Day three.
01:59 And that's it, so those are really
02:01 the basics of sqlite three, move on to the first video
02:05 and enjoy the next couple of Days.
