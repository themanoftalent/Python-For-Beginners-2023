00:00 Let's get started.
00:01 The first thing I need you to do is open up your browser
00:04 and head to sqlitebrowser.org.
00:09 It's this website here.
00:10 And this is for a database browser for SQLite.
00:14 It's a sort of GUI, a graphical user interface,
00:17 that allows you to see the contents of your database.
00:21 And this is important because sometimes
00:24 when you're checking things on the command line,
00:25 it's quite difficult to figure out.
00:28 You get that visual representation
00:29 of the columns and how everything looks like in the table.
00:33 Looking at this screenshot here, this is a Mac screenshot.
00:36 You can see there's your table here called Total Members.
00:41 There's the different columns and so on.
00:44 Now, we're going to use this a bit later on, but this is
00:47 pretty much the only setup step you're going to need to do.
00:49 So go ahead and download it
00:51 for your operating system of choice.
00:53 I'm using Windows, obviously, and my one,
00:57 once installed, looks like this.
00:59 Okay, no database is actually loaded into it.
01:02 We can use the open database button here
01:04 to load one in once we actually have it.
01:07 But for now, just get it installed.
01:10 That's sqlitebrowser.org.
