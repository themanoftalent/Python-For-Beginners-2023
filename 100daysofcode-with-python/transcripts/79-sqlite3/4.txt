00:03 I've got mine open already.
00:04 Control + O will actually open up our open dialogue,
00:09 and there is our address book database.
00:12 So let's open that up.
00:15 You can get a bit of information here,

00:19 but straight away, you can see
00:21 there's one table within this database,
00:23 with the name of details,
00:25 and it's got these three columns.
00:28 So let's actually go to browse data.
00:31 This looks more like what you sort of want to see
00:33 when you visualize your database.
00:36 There's the table name, there's our name column,
00:39 address column, and our phone number column.
00:42 In the next video, I'm going to show you
