00:00 Welcome to SQLite 3 Databases.
00:03 I'm Julian Sequeira and I'll be walking you through
00:06 possibly one of the most fun and satisfying libraries
00:09 you'll deal with on your Python journey.
00:11 I say that because at this point you'll be looking
00:14 at persistent data, more so than just a simple text file
00:20 or what have you.
00:21 SQLite 3 Databases allow you to actually use your SQL
00:25 knowledge to give you self-persistent databases.
00:29 It's as simple as that.
00:30 It's exactly what you expect if you've ever dealt
00:33 with databases before and it's really, really simple.
00:37 So these three days you're going to be creating your first
00:40 SQLite 3 database
00:43 and then you'll be learning how to inject data into a...
00:47 Print the data out and I've also included a couple of really
00:50 cool scripts that you should help you automate some
00:53 of your SQL journeys and also it should help you,
00:58 help guide you through your SQLite 3 learning.
01:00 So enjoy and get cracking.
