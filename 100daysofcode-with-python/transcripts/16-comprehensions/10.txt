00:00 Alright, you're almost there.
00:02 To get some more practice, I put together
00:04 two smaller exercises, or bites,
00:08 and one bigger co-challenge.
00:11 This one, you will recognize the name's list
00:14 but it's a little different
00:15 because you have to take duplicate names out
00:17 and sort the names and find the shortest first name
00:21 and, of course, you will be using this comprehensions.
00:24 Secondly, what we did not touch upon,
00:27 is dictionary comprehensions,
00:29 so, you might look that up
00:31 and go through bite 26, where you have to
00:34 do some operations on this dictionary
00:38 and this set using a dictionary comprehension.
00:41 And the co-challenge is Generators for Fun
00:44 and Profit, a challenge we run some time ago.
00:46 And this will be a fun one because you have to
00:48 turn this Unix pipline into multiple generators.
00:51 So, I think that's a great way to get some
00:54 more practice using generators.
00:56 Three exercises, see how far you can get
00:59 during this third day of this lesson
01:02 and, of course, share your work.
01:03 Put a tweet out with #100DaysOfCode.
01:06 It's a great way to get visibility of your work
01:09 and, of course, we'll be happy to see
01:11 how you progressed this section.
01:13 Good luck. Have fun. Keep calm and code in Python.
