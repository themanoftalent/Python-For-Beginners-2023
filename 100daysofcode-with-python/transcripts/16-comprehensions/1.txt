00:00 Welcome back to the 100 days of Python.
00:02 In the coming three days I will guide you
00:04 through list comprehensions and generators
00:07 two of my favorite features of the language.
00:09 We're going to look at how you can make
00:12 a for loop with an embedded if statement
00:15 more Pythonic by using list comprehensions,
00:19 then we will load in Harry Potter
00:21 and use list comprehensions to filter out
00:23 non valid and stop words.
00:26 Next up, generators.
00:28 We start very simple with the concept
00:31 of the yield statement writing a simple generator,
00:34 we look at the stop iteration exception,
00:37 and how the for loop catches that for you.
00:40 We move on to more interesting examples
00:43 and finally compare performance of lists
00:46 and generators, because if your data set grows
00:50 you definitely want to know about generators.
00:52 The second day I have practical exercises
00:56 to train your new gained list comprehension
00:59 and generator skills.
01:01 The third day I will show you solutions to those
01:04 exercises and I challenge you to take
01:07 a more advanced generator exercise
01:10 replicating Unix pipelines and it will be a lot of fun.
01:14 So, lets dive straight into those two Python power tools.
