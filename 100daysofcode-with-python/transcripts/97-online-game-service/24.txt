00:00 On the second day, you'll create the web services.
00:03 What are the various operations
00:06 you're going to need to do? You'll probably have a create and find user,
00:08 a game status, top scores, play round,
00:12 that kind of seems like it, but think
00:14 about how you want that game to play
00:16 if you chose something other than Hi-Low,
00:18 well, then I can't really guess, I can't really help you.
00:20 You don't need to write any client code,
00:22 you can just use Postman right here
00:24 then you can get it right there.
00:25 Of course, you use Postman like we did
00:28 to get it entirely working.
00:29 Remember, by the time we even created
00:31 our client code, we never touched
00:33 the web app again, it was totally working,
00:36 and that's partly 'cause I had prepared
00:38 a few of the tricky bits beforehand,
00:40 and that's also to a large degree
00:42 'cause we tested it out with Postman.
