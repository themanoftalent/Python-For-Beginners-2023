00:00 So we're over here, and we're calling service all_rolls,
00:04 and then we have to, remember you have to basically say,
00:07 service.all_rolls. Store that," and another thing
00:11 you have to say, raise_for_status
00:15 and then call JSON if that worked.
00:17 So that was really cumbersome.
00:20 So we created this thing called The uplink_helpers,
00:26 which had this basically uplink response handler
00:30 raise_for_status.
00:32 So if we go over here to our game,
00:34 oh sorry, api, excuse me, and we say this,
00:38 then it won't let any code through that fails.
00:42 So we know that it's safe to say .json right here,
00:45 'cause it's already tested it.
00:47 We can do better though.
00:48 We make it all of these methods return the dot.
00:50 JSON will response a result by adding one other thing.
00:55 This response to data.
00:56 So given a response, we just call response.json.
00:59 Otherwise, they throw a format error.
01:02 If we also put this at the top,
01:06 on the outside, not the inside.
01:08 The outside; That's important.
01:10 And this one goes on the inside.
01:11 Then we can come down here, and just print this.
01:15 And we should be our little devil, all the various pieces.
01:19 We do. Very nice. So I feel like our game service is in place,
01:23 and that really makes working with it nice and easy.
