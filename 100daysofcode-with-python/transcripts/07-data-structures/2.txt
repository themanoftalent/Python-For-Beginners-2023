00:00 Here is your three-day breakdown
00:02 for this lesson.
00:03 It's actually pretty simple.
00:05 There's not much to it because we are dealing
00:07 with data structures.
00:08 Super important though, so very important
00:11 that you get this down.
00:13 For the first day, we're just going to watch the videos.
00:16 Okay, there's not too much involved with this.
00:19 Just watch the videos that we have
00:21 on lists, tuples, dictionaries, and then just have
00:25 a play in the Python shell.
00:26 There's really not much to do.
00:28 So digest the content in the videos
00:30 and then hang around for day two.
00:33 Now the second day, it gets a bit more interesting.
00:37 What I'd like you to do is follow this link here,
00:39 this bites of Py code challenges promotion link.
00:45 This will give you free access to this specific bite.
00:48 This is a little challenge for you.
00:51 We just open it in a new tab.
00:54 Okay, I will log in with GitHub.
00:57 So you have to have your GitHub account ready.
01:00 And there you go.
01:02 So I'm already a premium member obviously,
01:04 but this will unlock this bite for you to work on
01:09 if you are not already a premium member.
01:12 This here is regarding dictionaries.
01:14 So have a good play with this.
01:16 Enjoy the challenge.
01:18 Work on it in the command line within your browser
01:22 and do that for day two.
01:26 Back for day three, this gets a little more tricky.
01:29 What I'd like you to do is a bit different as well.
01:31 I'd like you to go into this data.py file
01:36 which is here in the repo.
01:37 And I'd like you to just have a quick look
01:39 at the dictionary and the lists that are in there.
01:43 It is pretty much a list of just the United States states
01:48 and the acronym used for them.
01:52 So what you can do then is complete each one
01:57 of these little tasks, okay.
02:00 It will involve you actioning or working against
02:04 the list in the dictionary, pulling out data
02:06 and just playing around with them.
02:09 So you'll need to pull them into some,
02:12 whatever script, import them to whatever script
02:14 you'll be running this from.
02:16 And just remember that dictionaries are unsorted
02:20 so that should make this a little more tricky.
02:22 Alright, so that's your day three.
02:24 Just playing around with that data.py file.
02:26 Obviously if you want to play around with it
02:28 in any other way, go ahead, feel free.
02:31 But this is just a couple of quick,
02:33 these are just a couple of quick tasks for you to do
02:36 that should give you around 15 or 20 minutes worth
02:39 of practice which is what we're aiming for.
02:42 So enjoy, these are your three days
02:44 and let's get on with the video.
