00:00 All right, for the next 3 days,
00:02 creating this home inventory app,
00:04 it's going to be a bit different to everything
00:05 you've done so far and the reason is
00:07 is that we're not actually going to live code
00:10 the app line by line because that would just be
00:13 pretty boring and might take you forever.
00:15 So, take a look at this.
00:18 This is the ReadMe.
00:20 What I'd like you to do for the first day,
00:23 I should say, is watch 3 videos.
00:26 Watch them, one about the main menu,
00:28 the SQLite3 database access,
00:31 and then scrubbing malicious data.
00:33 Watch those 3.
00:34 That should take a significant amount
00:36 of time, maybe 15 minutes or so,
00:38 depending on how much time you have.
00:40 And, after that, start visualizing
00:43 how you're going to form and write your own app.
00:46 So after taking all of those things into account,
00:49 how are you going to do this yourself?
00:51 Feel free to copy along and copy
00:52 exactly what we've got in the repo, but obviously it will be
00:56 more beneficial if you write this yourself,
00:59 taking guidance from what we have, okay?
01:03 Get coding if you have the time.
01:05 Remember, I know we're all short of time,
01:07 so if you don't have the time, don't worry if you can't
01:09 get coding today 'cause these videos can be a bit lengthy.
01:13 But go ahead and code if you can, all right?
01:17 Day 2, I'm going to walk you through
01:20 an entire run-through of the app.
01:22 We're going to see how it functions,
01:24 how everything works together to form the final product.
01:28 Alright? And that's in the app demonstration video.
01:32 If you haven't already by this point,
01:34 start coding up your own solution
01:36 'cause you've only got another day and a bit
01:37 until you have to move onto the next lesson.
01:39 So, start coding your own app up.
01:41 Again, take guidance where you need to, all right?
01:44 And on the last day, there's another video for you to watch.
01:48 I'm not going to leave up to you just yet.
01:51 Watch the pitfalls and bugs issues, okay?
01:55 That video.
01:56 This is actually going to show you where the app fails,
01:59 and there are quite a few points that fails
02:01 because to make a fully functional,
02:03 bug-free app can take a fair bit of time,
02:06 and that's part of the learning process, okay?
02:08 I'm going to walk you through what fails,
02:11 and if you can, go through and see what you can fix, okay?
02:15 They're all issues that you'll need to take into account
02:18 in your own app, so this is a worthy exercise, okay?
02:22 And then if you're super quick, and you have even more time,
02:25 we'll get it out of the command line.
02:27 See if you can give it a GUI or even a web interface, okay?
02:31 And those are your 3 days,
02:33 a lot of watching, a lot of coding.
