00:00 Alright, our next goal is going to work on,
00:02 to be working on this add_doc_form here.
00:06 So what we want to do is we want to be able to drop in
00:09 some pieces, so we're going to come over
00:11 and add a little sublabel, and this is going to control,
00:15 this is going to basically be the label in our form.
00:17 We don't really program against it,
00:18 so we don't need to set the name,
00:20 but this'll be document name.
00:23 And let's make it a little more standout, make it bold.
00:26 Okay.
00:27 And then, we're going to have a text area where they can type.
00:30 Notice I can drop it in these different locations.
00:32 I'll drop it right here.
00:35 We can tighten that up by dragging that bit over.
00:41 Now this one, let's give this a name,
00:43 such as, like, textbox_doc_name.
00:47 And let's give it a placeholder
00:52 document_name like that.
00:54 I'll do exactly the same thing for the rest of the elements.
01:03 Okay, so I've done a little draggy droppy magic,
01:05 and gotten this far.
01:08 We have a document name, we have a category,
01:10 and this is going to be a dropdown, we'll fill that up.
01:12 This is going to be a text area, and we should
01:14 go ahead and give this a placeholder
01:17 so people see and document this little placeholder,
01:21 which'll only be there until they type text,
01:23 and we have this button, create document.
01:25 Let's do a little more work on this.
01:26 We want this to align to the right over here.
01:31 We want an icon.
01:33 Little plus sign, and let's change the color here.
01:40 Go with this blue, which I just grabbed
01:42 off somewhere on my screen, and let's make this,
01:44 you can type hex here if you want.
01:46 Three F's for white.
01:47 Okay, so there's our create document.
01:49 Let's go ahead and run this, see how it works.
01:51 Again, we can click around.
01:53 And now we can add a new document.
01:55 It says document name, the name,
01:57 look how cool that is, it's got nice little bootstrap forms,
01:59 nothing in our dropdown yet, contents here.
02:02 Nothing happens when we click,
02:03 but that's going to be what we do next,
02:05 is we're going to make this interactive
02:07 and do a little validation.
