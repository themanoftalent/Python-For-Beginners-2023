00:00 Well, our app is basically working.
00:02 Let's publish it.
00:03 Let's make it so you can get to it.
00:04 'Cause right now, when you click run,
00:06 there's no URL I can go to.
00:08 Now, I probably won't publish this
00:10 and leave it live for you.
00:12 Maybe I will, we'll see.
00:14 You can check the URL when I get there,
00:15 but notice right now there's publish this app
00:17 while it's running,
00:19 and we can either copy this private link,
00:22 or I could share it via public link.
00:25 If I do this let's call this.
00:27 That seems decent, right?
00:28 How about that?
00:30 You could use your own custom domain,
00:32 but I'm not going to do that. I'm going to just hit OK.
00:34 Now, if we close this, and we go open something else,
00:38 actually let's just open this in a private window.
00:43 Go to Anvil app.net.
00:47 What do we get?
00:54 We get our app, up and running, on the Internet!
00:57 It is now hosted as a web server, as a back end,
01:00 all of the stuff, super cool.
01:02 So we go over all docs, pull this up,
01:05 we can search, everything is working.
01:07 It's really fun, right?
01:08 Obviously so are those.
01:10 We can even add a final document.
01:12 And where are we going to put this?
01:14 Let's put it under press releases.
01:16 The amazing app is now alive.
01:19 Pair document, boom, takes us home right there at the top,
01:24 a final document.
01:25 The most recent one.
01:26 And we click on it, there's the details.
01:30 It was a little more than half-an-hour,
01:32 but not terribly long.
01:33 I mean we've built a non-trivial application,
01:37 and published it to the Internet
01:39 in a pretty short amount of time.
01:41 So, hopefully this application platform
01:45 is inspiring to you.
01:46 I don't know if it makes sense for all of your apps,
01:48 but for certain types of apps it's really,
01:50 really a cool one.
01:52 That's Anvil and full stack web apps made easy.
