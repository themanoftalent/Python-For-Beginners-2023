00:00 Good day guys, this is Julian Sequeira,
00:02 and welcome to iteration with itertools.
00:06 This is going to be a three day series
00:08 just touching on the more common,
00:11 arguably more common, usages of itertools.
00:15 We'll start off with a bit of a coverage
00:17 of what iteration is, very basic stuff,
00:20 and then we'll get straight on into itertools.
00:23 So carry on, move on to the three day overview
00:26 for some more detail,
00:28 and then we'll get straight into the code.
