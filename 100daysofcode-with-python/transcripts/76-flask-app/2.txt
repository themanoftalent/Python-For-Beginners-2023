00:00 Alrighty, before we start any of the programming
00:03 we need to do a little bit of set up, okay?
00:06 You can have a look at the, what you see on the screen here,
00:08 and you'll see that I've got
00:09 a bit of a folder hierarchy set up.
00:12 Now Flask, in order to operate,
00:14 it needs the route directory.
00:15 Now we're sticking really basic here, okay?
00:19 What you need to do is you'll have an,
00:21 I want you to create two files, first and foremost.
00:25 Wherever you're creating your Flask app,
00:26 I've created it in this directory here.
00:29 I want you to create an app.py file,
00:32 so that's this one here, app.py,
00:34 and a data file, that's for the next video.
00:38 All right, and then also create a templates folder,
00:41 like this one here,
00:42 and inside create a file called index.html.
00:46 You can use whatever editor you want
00:48 to create these files, just go ahead and create them,
00:50 and leave them empty, all right?
00:53 When you're done, it should look something like this.
00:57 And the one thing we're missing is
00:58 we haven't actually installed Flask,
01:00 so let's install that now using pip install.
01:04 Actually, what have I forgotten?
01:06 I've forgotten my virtual environment.
01:09 So shame on me, shame on me.
01:12 So, python -m venv venv
01:15 I'm just creating a virtual environment called venv.
01:18 And there it is there.
01:21 Now we can activate that, activate, and now it's running.
01:27 Now we can install Flask.
01:31 pip install flask, installs everything it needs,
01:34 including those lovely Jinja2 templates,
01:37 and there we go.
01:40 As I mentioned the Jinja2 templates,
01:42 that is what this directory is for.
01:46 So technically yes, this is a html file,
01:48 but it's going to behave like a Jinja2 template
01:50 when we get to it.
01:51 All right, move on to the next video and let's get cracking.
